I was selected as a recipient of the Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho - MEXT) Scholarship for Research Students from 2015 to 2017 for the duration of my Master's program at the University of Tokyo.
Later, I received a recommendation by the university for an extension of my scholarship for my PhD course until 2020.
