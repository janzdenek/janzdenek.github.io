The main motivation is to conceal private information such as license plate numbers, and house name plates that can appear in images. In this work, we propose a novel method for scene text erasing that approaches the problem as a general inpainting task. Unlike previous methods, which require pairs of original images containing text and images with the text removed, our method does not need corresponding image pairs for training. We use a separately trained scene text detector and an inpainting network. The scene text detector predicts segmentation maps of text instances, which are then used as masks for the inpainting network. The network for inpainting, trained on the Places2 dataset of indoors and outdoors scenes, fills in masked out regions in an input image and generates a final image with erased text. The results show that our method is able to remove text from images and naturally fill in the background.","tags":[],"title":"Erasing Scene Text Using a General Inpainting Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Zdenek","Hideki Nakayama"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1510531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510531200,"objectID":"7dcc3771246cf2ae0a3940279cc957ec","permalink":"https://janzdenek.github.io/publication/bag-of-local-convolutional-triplets/","publishdate":"2019-06-08T19:22:29+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bag-of-local-convolutional-triplets/","section":"publication","summary":"The increasing interest in scene text reading in multilingual environments raises the need to recognize and distinguish between different writing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for script identification in scene text using triplets of local convolutional features in combination with the traditional bag-of-visual-words model. Feature triplets are created by making combinations of descriptors extracted from local patches of the input images using a convolutional neural network. This approach allows us to generate a more descriptive codeword dictionary for the bag-of-visual-words model, as the low discriminative power of weak descriptors is enhanced by other descriptors in a triplet. The proposed method is evaluated on two public benchmark datasets for scene text script identification and a public dataset for script identification in video captions. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline and yields competitive results on all three datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Bag of Local Convolutional Triplets for Script Identification in Scene Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Zdenek","Hideki Nakayama"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1495584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495584000,"objectID":"0b4dd5f274806d253d1ca070ea717025","permalink":"https://janzdenek.github.io/publication/script-identification-using-bag-of-words-with-entropy-weighted-patches/","publishdate":"2019-06-08T19:23:23+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/script-identification-using-bag-of-words-with-entropy-weighted-patches/","section":"publication","summary":"The increasing interest in scene text reading in multilingual environments raises the need to recognize and distinguish between different writing systems.
